				<h1>Things I Enjoy Doing</h1>
				<p><b>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</b> is something i started doing more recently.<br> It has been very fun and interesting getting to learn something so useful and complex.<br>Along with being fun and making you think, it also is a great workout.  </p>

				<p><b>Boxing</b> Is another thing ive been getting into that has been very fun to do.<br>This helps you get your reflexes faster as well as get better at being hit.<br>there are also some good people that are at boxing that are good to get along with.   </p>

				<p><em>python</em> is a more intellectual activity ive been fascinated by.<br>It challenges you to think critically about problems.<br>Python give you the ability to do some very cool things as well like do complex calculations<br>with huge amounts of data.  </p>
